#
# Kernel: iconidentify/aurora-linux custom/sep (0cde04307749), aurora-silicon/linux aurora-wip plus the
# Secure Enclave (Touch ID) driver, Thunderbolt (#8), the Apple video
# decoder (#45), the M2 Max (t6021) profile and the consolidated Touch ID
# series (aurora-silicon/linux#69: matching after a reboot on every profile,
# M1 Pro J314s, j293 SPI mode, a scan in progress ended before sleep),
# Thunderbolt displays on M1 and M1 Pro/Max by default, and two displays
# through one dock on every M2 Pro/Max laptop (aurora-silicon/linux#8, with
# #46, #50 and #64), and the MacBook Neo (J700) work from #40, #42,
# #43, #54 and #55, including its Touch ID device tree.
# 11.20 adds Touch ID on the MacBook Air M2 15" (J415, aurora-silicon/linux#152),
# a retry from a fresh sensor registration when the first sensor patch fails at
# boot, battery time estimates that read "no data" instead of 0 (#53), the
# Omarchy boot logo in place of Tux, and aurora-wip through 3bb0a6104a11 (the
# MacBook Neo video decoder, PCIe bring-up and radio drivers, inert elsewhere).
# On a MacBook Neo the script keeps the Neo's own m1n1.
# 11.21 adds Bluetooth recovery for the Broadcom PCIe controllers: a radio
# wedged by an rfkill cycle under heavy traffic is reset on the next open, and
# its calibration and address restored (aurora-silicon/linux#7).
# 11.22 installs the VA-API bridge for the video decoder too, so players use
# the hardware decoder instead of falling back to software, and
# aurora-touchid-setup --help prints its usage instead of starting an enrolment.
# The display manager waits (up to 30 s) for the Apple display driver, so a
# late driver can't leave the built-in screen black, and reloading the Touch ID
# driver on M1 is refused with "reboot to re-attach" instead of hanging.
# 11.23 routes USB-C displays on the M2 Pro/Max MacBook Pros in the order the
# compositor pairs them, so two monitors attached at boot each keep their own
# modes, and describes the Touch ID sensor on every M2 Pro/Max MacBook Pro.
# 11.24 adds Touch ID on the MacBook Pro 14"/16" M1 Max and the MacBook Air 13"
# M2, untested on both. On those boards the script first keeps the boot.bin the
# Mac booted with on the EFI partition and prints how to restore it from macOS.
# 11.25 adds the in-tree Apple Neural Engine driver (aurora-silicon/linux#155),
# switched on for the M1 Max and M2 Max only, and the read-only SEP diagnostics
# under /sys/bus/platform/devices/*.sep/diag/. When omarchy-ane-dkms is
# installed the script says so: its modules take precedence over this kernel's.
# 11.26-rc1 is a supervised test build: 11.25 with the Neural Engine also
# switched on for the M1.
# It replaces linux-asahi (or linux-aurora) as a pacman package,
# so mkinitcpio and update-m1n1 run from their own hooks; on a GRUB Mac this
# script regenerates grub.cfg and keeps the previous kernel as a fallback entry.
#
# Touch ID: libfprint with the Apple SEP driver, fprintd, the apple-sep
# service, a sleep hook that stops fprintd before suspend (so a lock screen
# waiting for a finger at lid close can't leave the sensor claimed), and
# this Mac's own sensor calibration. After the reboot, run
# aurora-touchid-setup to enrol a finger and use it for sudo and the lock screen.
#
# m1n1: m1n1-aurora builds AsahiLinux/m1n1 main (3e354a24), which knows the
# macOS 26.5 to 27.0 firmware the MacBook Neo ships with, plus three patches:
# the SEP warm-registration guard and preboot-UUID forwarding from
# aurora-silicon/m1n1, and the usb4-N-pcie-adapter alias fallback
# (aurora-silicon/m1n1#4).
# On M2 and later the platform hands Linux an already-running Secure
# Enclave, and the driver attaches to it with one registration that can only be
# sent once per boot. Stock m1n1 asks the enclave for randomness on the way up,
# spending that attempt before Linux sees it. aurora-silicon/m1n1 has a guard
# that skips the request when the enclave is already running. On M1, where the
# enclave is still in its boot ROM, the guard never fires.
#
# Testing this build? Run with --agent-prompt for the test plan and the format
# to report results in.

agent_prompt() {

You are testing an experimental Secure Enclave / Touch ID kernel on an Apple
Silicon Mac. Work through this in order and report at the end. Do not skip the
identification step: nearly every past report was unusable because the machine
was not pinned down.

SAFETY, NON-NEGOTIABLE
  - This touches the Secure Enclave. Confirm the owner can DFU-restore this Mac
    before you start.
  - A default install is NOT read-only. On the first boot of a Mac with a
    Touch ID profile, the SEP driver loads automatically, creates an identity
    keybag and writes to the enclave's anti-replay store (xART) -- before
    anyone enrols a finger. If the owner cannot DFU-restore, install with
    --read-only instead, before the first reboot:
      curl -fsSL https://github.com/iconidentify/aurora-linux/releases/latest/download/install-aurora-sep.sh | bash -s -- --read-only
    A 'blacklist apple_sep' line does not prevent this on its own; the
    installer detects one and leaves the driver off.
  - Do not run any enrol/delete/re-provision loop unless the owner asks for
    it in writing: repeated cycles drift a device-wide counter.
  - Do not paste key material, serial numbers, or the contents of
    mesa_calibration.bin into a report.

0. CONFIRM YOU HAVE THE CURRENT BUILD
   Results against a superseded build waste everyone's time, and a saved copy
   of this script installs its own packages forever. This script checks on
   every install and prints either "<tag> is the current release" or a warning
   naming the newer one. To check without installing:

     curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/iconidentify/aurora-linux/releases/latest \
       | grep -m1 '"tag_name"' 

   Always fetch the script from the "latest" URL rather than a tag you were
   handed, so you get the current one automatically:

     curl -fsSL https://github.com/iconidentify/aurora-linux/releases/latest/download/install-aurora-sep.sh | bash

   State the tag you installed in your report. If you were given a specific
   older tag on purpose, say so and say why.

1. IDENTIFY THE MACHINE
     tr -d '\0' < /proc/device-tree/compatible; echo
     for p in os-fw-version system-fw-version iboot2-version; do
       printf '%s = ' "$p"
       tr -d '\0' < /proc/device-tree/chosen/asahi,$p 2>/dev/null; echo
     done
     uname -r; pacman -Q linux-aurora m1n1-aurora libfprint aurora-touchid
   asahi,system-fw-version is the sepOS the enclave actually runs and is the
   single most useful line in the whole report. asahi,os-fw-version is only the
   stub. Report both; they are often different.

2. CONFIRM THE BOOTLOADER GUARD (M2 and later)
   In the m1n1 stage 2 boot log, expect:
     SEP: Preserving iBoot warm registration; seeding RNG from ADT
   and expect NO line reading "SEP: couldn't get enough random bytes".
   You should also see the OS identity forwarded:
     FDT: apfs-preboot-uuid = '<uuid>'
   On M1 neither line is expected: the enclave is cold and m1n1 talks to it
   normally. If you see the "couldn't get enough random bytes" line on any
   machine, the stock m1n1 is still in boot.bin - say so and stop, because every
   later result is then measuring the wrong thing.

3. DRIVER ATTACH
   The driver is already loaded at boot by apple-sep.service; do not reload
   it. Its write mode was fixed at install time. Read what it did:
     sudo dmesg | grep -iE 'apple_sep|apple-mesa'
   The xART line ends "writes ENABLED" or "writes disabled" -- quote it, and
   say which you expected.
   PASS:  "attach: N endpoints advertised in M messages" with N >= 7, and
          /dev/sep-bio exists.
   FAIL:  "attach: 0 messages received but no endpoint advertised", or no
          apple_sep lines at all. Capture the whole block either way.
   If the profile line says a SoC you did not expect, report that verbatim.
   On every MacBook Pro M2 Pro/Max (J414s, J414c, J416s, J416c) it reads
   "T6020/J414s", on the MacBook Pro 14"/16" M1 Max (J314c, J316c)
   "T6000/J316s", and on the MacBook Air 13" M2 (J413) "T8112/J415"; those are
   expected.
   If "CREATE_KEYBAG" fails with status -13, quote your system-fw-version.
   Every M2-family Mac that has created its keybag was on 26.6.x; on an older
   one, update macOS to 26.6.x, boot back into Linux, re-run the installer and
   report again. If it still fails on 26.6.x, that is the report we need.
   The sensor itself: "sudo dmesg | grep apple-mesa" should say the power line
   came "from the device node". Quote it if it says anything else.

4. IF ATTACH FAILED, GET THE MAILBOX STATE
     sudo busybox devmem 0x396408110 32   # A2I control (t600x/t602x)
     sudo busybox devmem 0x396408114 32   # I2A control
     grep -i mbox /proc/interrupts
   Those addresses are for t600x and t602x. The mailbox base differs per SoC,
   so take it from the device tree rather than a table:

     sudo cat /proc/device-tree/soc/mbox@*/reg 2>/dev/null | xxd | head -2
     # or read the sep_mbox node address from your board's dtsi:
     #   t8103            0x242408000  -> 0x242408110 / 0x242408114
     #   t8112            0x25e408000  -> 0x25e408110 / 0x25e408114
     #   t600x, t602x     0x396408000  -> 0x396408110 / 0x396408114
     #   t8140 (Neo)      0x282608000  (a v4 mailbox: report the base and
     #                    the /proc/interrupts lines, not these offsets)

   Bit 0 is the enable; a non-zero FIFO count with an unchanged read pointer
   means the enclave never took the message. Report the raw values, not your
   reading of them.

5. TOUCH ID END TO END (only if step 3 passed)
     aurora-touchid-setup
   Enrol one finger, then:
     fprintd-verify
   Then REBOOT and run fprintd-verify again without re-enrolling. Matching
   right after enrolment and matching after a reboot are different paths (the
   second restores the enrolment from disk), so report them separately.
   If a verify fails, the driver logs the step that ended it:
     sudo dmesg | grep -E 'verify:|scrd:|Touch ID|catacomb|matching unavailable'
   fprintd's "verify-unknown-error" is not a result on its own; quote those
   lines with it.
   Then check the consumers the owner actually cares about: sudo, polkit, and
   the lock screen. Report each as pass/fail separately - partial success here
   is the normal outcome and is worth knowing precisely.

6. THUNDERBOLT AND DISPLAYPORT - TEST THIS EVEN IF YOU CAME FOR TOUCH ID
   This build carries the Thunderbolt/USB4 display and PCIe work, and it needs
   hardware reports as much as the enclave does. Do not skip it because the
   machine has no dock: "no dock available" is itself a useful answer, and
   step 6a still applies.

   6a. The controllers (no dock needed)
         ls /sys/bus/platform/devices/ | grep cio
         sudo dmesg | grep -iE 'thunderbolt|usb4|acio|tunnel' | head -30
       Expect one *.cio device per controller, bound to thunderbolt-apple-acio.
       An EMPTY /sys/bus/thunderbolt/devices/ with nothing plugged in is
       normal: routers only appear when a device is attached. Do not report
       that as a failure.
       Also normal, on every Mac except the M1 Air and 13" M1 MacBook Pro:
         PCIe-C tunnel disabled: m1n1 handoff is not initialized
       Anything behind a dock's PCIe controller -- ethernet, storage, and on
       Thunderbolt 3 docks such as the CalDigit TS3 the USB ports too -- only
       works on t8103 so far. Displays, and USB on USB4 docks, do not need the
       PCIe tunnel. Report the line only if you see it on a t8103.

   6b. With a dock or a DisplayPort monitor, in this order:
         - attached at boot: does the display come up, and at what resolution
           and refresh rate
         - hot unplug: does the tunnel tear down cleanly, no hang, no stuck
           compositor
         - hot replug: does the display come back, same mode as before
         - repeat both of the above on the SECOND USB-C port, not just the
           first: the ports are separate controllers and have behaved
           differently
         - two displays or a dual-output dock, if you have one
         - M2 Pro/Max: two monitors plugged straight into two USB-C ports
           (no dock), attached at boot. Does each come up at its own native
           resolution? Quote "hyprctl monitors" (name, mode, and the port each
           is on). Then log out and back in, and repeat.
         - PCIe behind the dock: ethernet, USB storage, card readers - do they
           enumerate and still work after a replug

   6c. Across suspend:
         systemctl suspend
       Then wake and re-check: display back, dock devices back, and
       /dev/sep-bio still present. Report anything that needed a replug to
       recover.

7. HARDWARE VIDEO DECODE
   Play an H.264 file and an HEVC file and confirm it is not silently falling
   back to software:
     sudo dmesg | grep -iE 'avd|apple-vpu' | tail -20
   Report which codecs you exercised and at what resolution.

8. ONE SUSPEND/RESUME CYCLE AT THE END
   Ask the owner to lock the screen and, while it waits for a fingerprint,
   close the lid. Then open it and unlock with the finger. Report whether
   the Mac woke and whether the finger unlocked it, and quote:
     sudo dmesg | grep -E 'Touch ID: ending|still running|PM: suspend'
   Re-check /dev/sep-bio, the display and the dock after resume.

9. NEURAL ENGINE
   This build carries the in-tree Apple Neural Engine driver
   (aurora-silicon/linux#155), switched on only for the M1 Max and the M2 Max.
   On every other Mac no Neural Engine lines are expected, and that is a pass.
     pacman -Q omarchy-ane-dkms 2>/dev/null   # if installed, say so: its modules replace this kernel's
     modinfo -F filename ane ane_t6021
     ls -l /dev/accel/ 2>/dev/null
     sudo dmesg | grep -iE '\bane\b|ane_t6021|neural' | head -40
   M1 Max PASS: the ane module is bound, /dev/accel/accel0 exists, and the
   module path is under kernel/drivers/accel/ane (not updates/dkms).
   M2 Max: without the Neural Engine firmware, expect a firmware load error and
   nothing else broken. With it (fetched by Joshua Warren's
   omarchy-ane-firmware-fetch), expect ane_t6021 bound and /dev/accel/accel0.
   If omarchy-ane's tools are installed, also run omarchy-ane-check, and on an
   M2 Max omarchy-ane-check --smoke; quote their result lines.
   Report any kernel log line at emergency or alert level, and whether idle
   battery drain changed against the previous build. If the Mac does not finish
   booting, add module_blacklist=ane,ane_t6021 to the kernel command line from
   the boot menu, and report that.

   Report "not tested" honestly rather than guessing, for any of the above.

HOW TO REPORT
  Open one issue per Mac at https://github.com/iconidentify/aurora-linux/issues
  (not on omacom/linux#7 any more), with the first line of the report as its
  title. Post later results for the same Mac as comments on that issue.
  Structure it exactly like this:

    # <board> (<marketing name>): <one-line outcome>
    **Machine:** apple,jXXX / apple,tXXXX, <model>
    **Firmware:** asahi,os-fw-version = X, asahi,system-fw-version = Y
    **Build:** <release tag>, linux-aurora <ver>, m1n1-aurora <ver>
    **m1n1 guard:** fired / did not fire / stock m1n1 still installed
    **Touch ID:** enrol <pass/fail>, verify <pass/fail>, verify after reboot <pass/fail>
    **Thunderbolt:** <dock model, or "no dock"> on port <1 / 2 / both>

    ## What worked
    ## What did not
    ## Logs
    (fenced blocks, trimmed to the relevant lines - never a whole dmesg)

  Rules for the write-up:
    - Lead with the outcome, not the narrative.
    - Quote log lines exactly; do not paraphrase an error.
    - Say explicitly what you did NOT test. "No dock available" and "only
      tested port 1" are useful answers; silence is not.
    - Name the dock and the display mode. "CalDigit TS3 Plus, 3840x2160 @ 60"
      is actionable; "external display worked" is not.
    - If something failed, give the last known-good state and the first bad one.
    - Do not claim a fix works because it compiled or because the module
      loaded. Only step 3's endpoint line and step 5's verify-match count.

//! Thermal limit of the M3 runtime backend's GPU performance cap (`asahi.m3_thermal`).
//!
//! Without it (`off`, the default with the built-in InitData image) the firmware is given a
//! fixed highest performance state (5 of 8 with device-tree InitData: 1056 of 1380 MHz on
//! J516S) and nothing watches temperatures. The firmware's own die temperature controller is
//! off in the InitData this driver builds. With device-tree InitData the default is `on`;
//! `asahi.m3_thermal=off` restores the fixed cap exactly.
//!
//! With it, the InitData gives the firmware the whole table as its highest state (the
//! "ceiling"), and what bounds the firmware is the runtime cap: the Globals performance-state
//! cap and power-interface state targets, which the firmware keeps reading while it runs (a
//! host moves the cap with a single store, with no message). The runtime cap starts at the
//! fixed cap of `off` (the "safe cap") and never goes below it, so at worst the GPU runs as it
//! does without the limit.
//!
//! - `hold`: the runtime cap stays at the safe cap for the whole boot. The GPU then runs exactly
//!   as with `off`, provided the firmware follows the runtime cap; the per-job check below
//!   proves or disproves that before `on` is used.
//! - `on`: the runtime cap follows the hottest SoC die temperature, read by a work item every
//!   500 ms while the GPU is busy (every 2 s when idle) from the thermal zones in [`ZONES`]
//!   that exist: the SMC's die sensors and the PMP's CPU cluster sensors (see [`ZONES`]):
//!   * at or above `critical` (`hot` + 8 C): the safe cap at once;
//!   * at or above `hot` (`asahi.m3_thermal_hot`, default 80 C): one state lower, at most every
//!     500 ms and once per reading;
//!   * at or below `cool` (`hot` - 10 C): one state higher, at most every 2 s and once per
//!     reading, up to the ceiling;
//!   * no zone, a zone that cannot be read, a reading outside 10..=125 C, one older than 3 s
//!     or one that has not changed at all for 60 s: the safe cap at once.
//!
//! The defaults leave a wide margin below the limits the boot firmware's device tree gives this
//! machine (a 94 C GPU die target and a 111 C SoC-hot temperature), because the sensors may
//! read cooler than the GPU's hottest spot (the PMP's are CPU cluster sensors), and this limit
//! reacts in steps of hundreds of milliseconds while the firmware changes state within the cap
//! much faster.
//!
//! The cap is changed only by the job thread, after a job has retired, right before the state
//! the firmware reports is checked. After a lowering the previous cap is tolerated for 1 s. A
//! reported state above the runtime cap in 20 consecutive checks spanning at least 3 s means
//! the firmware does not follow the runtime cap, so this limit cannot work: the GPU is then
//! marked failed, as for a state above the ceiling.
//!
//! The decisions are in `m3_thermal_policy`, which host tests drive; this module reads the
//! sensors, publishes the cap and logs.
